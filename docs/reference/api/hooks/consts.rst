Constants
=========

Here we lists named :ref:`actions`, :ref:`filters` and :ref:`contexts` that are used across Lekt. These are simply hook variables that we can refer to across the Lekt codebase without having to hard-code string names. The API is slightly different and less verbose than "native" hooks.

.. autoclass:: tutor.hooks.Filters
